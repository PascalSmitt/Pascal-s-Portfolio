<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Yo! It's your boy Kelechi Anyanwu Pascal(a.k.a Smitt). Just here to tell you a little bit about myself.
</p>
<h2>Family and Childhood</h2>
<p>
  I'm the third child of four children. I've got two sisters and one brother. 
  I don't quite remember too much about my childhood, so I'm just gonna skip that part for now.
</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
  I completed my primary education at STARTRIGHT Childhood Learning and Development Center Owerri(Used to be so much fun back then), then I moved right into junior secondary after primary three(I was only 8 then).
  After spending three rough and interesting years at FGCE(Federal Government College Enugu) I switched to Kings College Lagos(Floreat!! to all the KCOBs out there) where I completed my senior secondary education and subsequently wrote my WASSCE.
  I'm currently an electrical and electronic engineering undergrad at University of Lagos.

  And that's about it for now. To get to know me more you can contact me through any of the means on my contact page.
